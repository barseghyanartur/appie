Installation of Appie may be:
  - installation from scratch
  - upgrade to new version
  - update of existing version

In the first case, use 'make install', in the second case use 'make upgrade',
in the last case use 'make update'.

Installation from scratch is straightforward: type 'make install' as root
user. This should be the only time you need to be root!

You may also go for manual installation:

* copy appie.conf.example to appie.conf and fill in the variables as
  to you needs.
* create group appadmin
* Add all users that need to be able to work with appie to this group:
    usermod -G appadmin <user id>
* Make sure the directory specified in appie.conf as APP_BASE exists,
  and that the group appadmin has write access to it, and the 's' bit
  set. 


You'll need to change the /etc/sudoers file as well... It should be
configured like so:

-------------

# User alias specification
#
User_Alias APPADM = <list of users for appie admin tasks, comma separated>

# Cmnd alias specification
#
Cmnd_Alias APP_SU = /bin/su - app-*
Cmnd_Alias APP_GDEL = /usr/sbin/groupdel app-*
Cmnd_Alias APP_UADD = /usr/sbin/useradd -d * -c * -s /bin/bash app-*
Cmnd_Alias APP_UDEL = /usr/sbin/userdel -r app-*
Cmnd_Alias APP_CHOWN = /bin/chown app-*
Cmnd_Alias APP_UMOD = /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G app-* *

# Add to user privilege specs
#
APPADM  ALL=NOPASSWD:APP_SU,APP_GDEL,APP_UADD,APP_UDEL,APP_CHOWN,APP_UMOD

-------------

Make sure this configuration doesn't override less specific settings,
especially for 'su'. This might cause nasty problems... Also, check
precise paths of the user- and group commands.
