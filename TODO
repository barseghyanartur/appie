* auto apache config for plone
  This should be a function within the Plone plugin, executable by root

* apps over different machines
  I suppose we could use public key authentication to enable this
  transparantly

* better re-configuration support for profile and other config files
(zope.conf)

* Solve additional locations for an application, like data dirs, etc.

* SSH command profile settings?

* Do we still need appuser group?

* Fix for RH: change group for created user and change default mod 700
  - discuss: do wee need application group?
  - should appadmin create, then become the other group?
