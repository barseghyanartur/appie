Use app to setup a base application environment. The main command for
app does this, but more commands are available to move applications or
environments, create and destroy environments, etc.

The app module can set up an application structure based on a
directory structure like the following, including users per
environment, and a group for the whole application:

$BASE/<app>/tst
          ./acc
          ./prd

TST is an environment specifically for testing, ACC is for end-user
acceptance and PRD is for production environments.

Commands:

* main (create app)

Generate a full application structure. Some interactive questions will
be asked, for example what environments to create, unless you specify
all on the command line.


* list

List all applications and environments.


* mkenv

Create a single environment within an existing application.


* rmapp

Remove a complete application, including users and groups.


* rmenv

Remove an invironment, including the user.
