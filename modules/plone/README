The appie plone plugin enables appadmins to make Plone versions
available, and application environment users to install plone versions
into their environment.


The following commands are available:

* sys_available

Check what versions of Plone are available on the download site
(configured in plone.conf).


* sys_install [python version]

Install a version of Plone onto a system. The user should have
permission to install into that directory.


* available

Check what version of Plone is available on the system, and can be
used to install into a local instance. Use this command as application
user.


* main

Install a Plone version into you local instance. This is done by
symlinking the version from within the python version that is used for
your Zope instance.
